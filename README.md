We do this using python library Tensorflow .TensorFlow is an open-source machine learning framework developed by the Google Brain team. It's widely used for various machine learning and deep learning tasks, including neural networks, deep learning models, and other numerical computations. 
TensorFlow can do:

Deep Learning: TensorFlow is particularly well-suited for building and training deep neural networks. You can create a wide range of neural network architectures, including feedforward neural networks, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and more.

Custom Machine Learning Models: TensorFlow allows you to build custom machine learning models, giving you control over the model's architecture and behavior. This is helpful when working on unique or specialized tasks.

Natural Language Processing (NLP): TensorFlow offers tools and libraries for building natural language processing models, including text classification, sentiment analysis, language translation, and more.

Computer Vision: It provides a rich ecosystem for computer vision tasks, allowing you to create models for image classification, object detection, and image segmentation.

Reinforcement Learning: TensorFlow supports reinforcement learning, which is essential for building agents that can learn to interact with and make decisions in various environments.

Transfer Learning: Transfer learning with pre-trained models is made easy in TensorFlow, allowing you to leverage existing models and fine-tune them for specific tasks.

Distributed Computing: TensorFlow can be used for distributed computing, which is valuable for training large models or handling big datasets.

Mobile and Embedded Devices: TensorFlow provides TensorFlow Lite for deploying machine learning models on mobile devices, edge devices, and embedded systems.

Scalability: TensorFlow can be scaled to handle both small and large datasets, and it can run on different hardware configurations, including CPUs, GPUs, TPUs, and cloud-based clusters.

Community and Ecosystem: TensorFlow has a large and active community, offering a wide range of resources, including documentation, tutorials, and pre-built models.

Visualization Tools: TensorFlow provides tools like TensorBoard for visualizing training and evaluation metrics, model graphs, and more.

Production Deployment: TensorFlow Serving allows you to serve machine learning models in production environments.
